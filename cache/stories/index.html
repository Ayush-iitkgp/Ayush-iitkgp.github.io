    <p>Mathematics itself is too enthralling to resist. More so, when coupled with insights from Computer Science, the satisfaction of learning is remarkable.</p>

<p>I am a backend engineer at [Tier Mobility SE] (https://www.tier.app/) based in Berlin, Germany.</p>
<p>Before moving to Berlin, I was an Assistant Tech Lead at <a href="https://www.adacta-fintech.com/">Adacta Fintech</a> based in Slovenia spearheading the development of insurance solutions for Europe-based companies such as the Sava and DVA Insurance while honing my skills as a full-stack engineer. </p>
<p>Before plunging into software development, I was a Deep Learning Engineer at <a href="http://eventregistry.org/">EventRegistry</a> where I was developing data science pipeline using deep learning based text classification algorithms and deploying it using rest API. I also worked as a Data Scientist at <a href="http://www.zemanta.com/">Zemanta, an Outbrain Company</a> based in Ljubljana, Slovenia. My day to day work involves implementing and analyzing the real-time machine algorithms and integrating it with the bidder infrastructure.</p>
<p>Before moving to Slovenia, I worked as the Product Engineer at <a href="https://www.sprinklr.com/">Sprinklr</a>, India where I was involved in implementing the machine learning module in the data flow execution pipeline using Kafka, Spark, and Spring framework.</p>
<p>I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology(IIT), Kharagpur with majors in Mathematics and Computer Science and a micro-specialization in Optimization Theory and Applications. My interests lie in the intersection of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. More specifically, I am intrigued by the current trend in the field of Optimization, Data Analytics and Machine Learning and their application in improving our day to day lives.</p>
<p>I have also been involved in the project titled "<a href="https://julialang.org/soc/projects/diffeq.html#machine-learning-tools-for-classification-of-qualitative-traits-of-differential-equation-solutions">Machine learning tools for classification of qualitative traits of differential equation solutions</a>" where I developed set of a tools for easily classifying parameters using machine learning tooling for users inexperienced with machine learning under the mentorship of <a href="http://www.chrisrackauckas.com/">Chris Rackauckas</a>.</p>
<p>As Google Summer of Code 2016 student, I implemented the support for the <strong>Complex SemiDefinite Programming</strong> in <a href="http://convexjl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Convex.jl</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://people.orie.cornell.edu/mru8/">Madeleine Udell</a> and <a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~dvij/">Dvijotham Krishnamurthy</a>. I have also been part of the project involving the application of optimization techniques in field of portfolio optimization. </p>
<p>While trying to keep up with the rapid advancements in technology, I like to spend my free time traveling, hiking, running and playing cricket.</p>
