    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mathematics itself is too enthralling to resist. Moreso, when coupled with the insights from Computer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Science, the satisfaction of learning is remarkable.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a final year undergarduate pursuing at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur pursuing majors in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mathematics and Computer Science with micro-specialization in Optimization Theory and Applications. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My interests lie in the intersection of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. More specifically, I am &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intrigued by the current trend in the field of Optimization, Data Analytics and Machine Learning and their &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;application in improving our day to day lives. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I have been involved in the application of optimization techniques in the field of portfolio &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;optimization. Currently, I am implementing the support for the **Complex SemiDefinite Programming** in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Convex.jl](http://convexjl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) under the guidance of [Madeleine Udell](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/mru8/) and [Dvijotham Krishnamurthy](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~dvij/).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While trying to keep up with the rapid advancements in technology, I like to spend my free time travelling, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;writing, running and playing Cricket in one of the grounds at [Tata Sports Complex.](https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Tata_Sports_Complex)</p>
