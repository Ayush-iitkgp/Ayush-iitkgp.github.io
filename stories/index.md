    <p>Mathematics itself is too enthralling to resist. More so, when coupled with insights from Computer Science, the satisfaction of learning is remarkable.</p>

I am a Deep Learning Engineer at [EventRegistry](http://eventregistry.org/) where I am involved in developing data science pipeline using deep learning based text classification algorithms and deploying i using rest API.

Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist at [Zemanta, an Outbrain Company](http://www.zemanta.com/) based in Ljubljana, Slovenia. My day to day work involves implementing and analyzing the real-time machine algorithms and integrating it with the bidder infrastructure.

Before joining Zemanta, I worked as the Product Engineer, Data Engine at Sprinklr, India where I was involved in implementing the machine learning module in the data flow execution pipeline using Kafka, Spark, and Spring framework.

I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology(IIT), Kharagpur with majors in Mathematics and Computer Science and a micro-specialization in Optimization Theory and Applications. My interests lie in the intersection of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. More specifically, I am intrigued by the current trend in the field of Optimization, Data Analytics and Machine Learning and their application in improving our day to day lives. 

I have also been involved in the project titled "[Machine learning tools for classification of qualitative traits of differential equation solutions](https://julialang.org/soc/projects/diffeq.html#machine-learning-tools-for-classification-of-qualitative-traits-of-differential-equation-solutions)" where I developed set of a tools for easily classifying parameters using machine learning tooling for users inexperienced with machine learning under the mentorship of [Chris Rackauckas](http://www.chrisrackauckas.com/).

As Google Summer of Code 2016 student, I implemented the support for the **Complex SemiDefinite Programming** in [Convex.jl](http://convexjl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) under the guidance of [Madeleine Udell](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/mru8/) and [Dvijotham Krishnamurthy](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~dvij/). I have also been part of the project involving the application of optimization techniques in field of portfolio optimization. 

While trying to keep up with the rapid advancements in technology, I like to spend my free time traveling, hiking, running and playing cricket.
