    <p>Mathematics itself is too enthralling to resist. Moreso, when coupled with insights from Computer Science, the satisfaction of learning is remarkable.


I am a final year graduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology(IIT), Kharagpur pursuing majors in Mathematics and Computer Science with micro-specialization in Optimization Theory and Applications. My interests lie in the intersection of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. More specifically, I am intrigued by the current trend in the field of Optimization, Data Analytics and Machine Learning and their application in improving our day to day lives. 

Recently, I have been involved in the application of optimization techniques in field of portfolio optimization. Currently, I am implementing the support for the **Complex SemiDefinite Programming** in [Convex.jl](http://convexjl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) under the guidance of [Madeleine Udell](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/mru8/) and [Dvijotham Krishnamurthy](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~dvij/).

While trying to keep up with the rapid advancements in technology, I like to spend my free time traveling, writing, running and playing cricket in one of the grounds at [Tata Sports Complex.](https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Tata_Sports_Complex)</p>
