Mathematics itself is too enthralling to resist. Moreso, when coupled with the insights from Computer Science, the satisfaction of learning is remarkable.

I am a final year undergarduate pursuing at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur pursuing majors in Mathematics and Computer Science. My research interests lie in the intersection of Machine Learning and Robotics. More specifically, I am intrigued by the current research in the field of Deep Learning. I am also passionate about autonomous robotics, especially those which draw inspiration from nature. Add to that the passion for knowing all about human intelligence, and life's good.

While trying to keep up with the rapid advancements in learning-based approaches, I spend a considerable amount of my time tinkering with quadcopters at the ARK Lab, or building my own swarm of robots at the SIK Lab. For updates on the amazing work we do in our Robotics Labs and my occasional ramblings, look up my blog.
