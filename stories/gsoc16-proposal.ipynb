    "\n",
    "Hello, I am Ayush Pandey, a 4th year undergraduate student pursuing an Integrated Master of Science(MS) degree in Mathematics and Computing Sciences with micro-specialization in Optimization Theory and Applications\n",
    "at IIT Kharagpur, India. I am proficient in C, C++, Java and Python. I am moderately proficient in Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Previous Relevant Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "My first encounter with the field of optimization and operation research was during my 3rd year in the college when I took a course in Operation Research. As a part of the course, we were asked to code the Linear Programming methods ([source code](https://github.com/Ayush-iitkgp/Linear-Programming)). I enjoyed the course a lot and since then have been reading optimization. I was also chosen to be a part of the IIT Kharagpur's contingent in [4th InterIIT TechMeet](http://interiittech.com/) where IIT Kharagpur won gold medal in Portfolio Optimization event in which the participants had to present the solution for the Cardinality Constrained Efficient Frontier which we solved using 3 heuristic methods namely Genetic Algorithm, Tabu Search and Simulated Annealing ([source code](https://github.com/Ayush-iitkgp/InterIIT-TechMeet)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ongoing semester, I am also taking a course on Non-Linear Programming where I am reading and programming ([source code](https://github.com/Ayush-iitkgp/Non-Linear-Programming)) in MATLAB the optimization techniques like golden-section method, Nelder-Mead Simplex method and derivative methods such as steepest descent and Newton method for unconstrained optimization and penalty function, interior point method for constrained optimization.\n",

    "\n",
    "`1. What do you want to have completed by the end of the program?`\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the program, I want to add support for complex-domain optimization problem in Convex.jl which presently supports only real-domain optimization problems.\n",

    "Many problems in applied sciences are posed as optimization problems over the complex field such as Phase retrieval from sparse signals, or designing an FIR filter given a desired frequency response. The present approach is to manually convert the complex-domain problems to real-domain problems ([example](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cvxgrp/cvxpy/blob/master/examples/notebooks/WWW/fir_chebychev_design.ipynb)) and pass to solvers. The correct approach to such problem is to make existing packages like Convex.jl deal with complex-domain problems directly without converting them to real-domain problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "`3. What are the potential hurdles you might encounter, and how can you resolve them?`\n",
    "\n",

    "Yes, at the the end of week 8, the support for the complex-domain problems would be ready for testing for the Julia community.\n",

    "\n",
    "But the most astonishing feature of Julia is that it is empowering. In other high-level languages, the users can not be developers because developing new packages in those language require the users to know the intricacies of low-level language whereas in Julia, users can develop packages for their needs in Julia itself without compromising with the speed.

The **\"solve!\"** would be used to solve the SDP and a new instance of user-defined type **\"Solution\"** is created which has value of the primal and dual variables, status(Optimal, Unbounded), optimum value of the objective function stored in it in different fields. Now, when we have the solution of the real SDP, the next step is to transform the solution of the real SDP to its corresponding complex SDP. Also, the default setting in Convex.jl prints the output from solver(which we disable by passing in verbose=0), I would also need to change the setting so that the output from the solver is not displayed by default as we would not want the solution of the real SDP to be outputted to the user by default."

    "This step is exactly reverse of step 3. In this step, we use the transformation $\\tau^{-1}$ to obtain the solution of the complex SDP from the solution of the real SDP which is obtained in step 4. Lets us assume that the primal value of the variables of the real SDP is stored in temporary variable $Y$ which is a square matrix of order $2n$. As from the transformation $\\tau^{-1}$, it can be easily verified that first $n$ columns of first $n$ rows contain the real part of the complex matrix $X$ and the next $n$ columns contain negative the imaginary part of the matrix $X$. Also, the optimum value of the complex SDP is half the optimum value of the complex SDP. Thus, I would need to implement a new function which would take the primal values and the optimum values of the real SDP and convert to the corresponding complex SDP. This would be done by creating a function which would take the user-defined type **\"Solution\"** (this contains the solution for the real SDP) as an argument and convert it to complex-domain solution. I would also be required to make our solver intelligent so that it could distinguish between real and complex-domain SDPs. This would be done by creating a new field **\"domain\"** in the user-defined type **\"Solution\"** which would take values as either **real or complex**. If the the field **domain** contains value complex then the transformation $\\tau^{-1}$ would be called else no need."
