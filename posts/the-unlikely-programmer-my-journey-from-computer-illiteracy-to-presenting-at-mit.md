## Introduction

Only a select few of my closest friends are aware of my journey from computer illiteracy to becoming a computer scientist. Recently, my very dear friend and my first mentor, [Anshit Mandloi](), encouraged me to pen down a blog post about my progression—how I managed to transcend my lack of knowledge in computers and present my work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) within four years. 

The purpose of sharing this deeply personal account is to provide inspiration to individuals who, like me, hail from similar backgrounds and may be grappling with doubts about their potential to navigate the vast landscape of technology. Through this blogpost, my hope is to kindle the spark of possibility that with unwavering determination, the most remarkable transformations can be well within our reach.

## The Beginnings

I come from small town situated in one of the less developed regions of North India. Hailing from a family of eight, my father shouldered the role of the sole provider. In such circumstances, pursuing quality education proved to be an uphill battle, rendering the idea of having a computer at home an unattainable dream. Hence, my exposure to computers was limited to the few sessions we had during our high school curriculum. 

However, destiny had its designs, I managed to emerge successful in the IIT-JEE exam (an exam with an acceptance rate of a 1 in 500). This paved the way for my academic journey, leading me to opt for the study of Mathematics and Computer Science at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur.

## The Challenges

IIT Kharagpur marked the beginning of a gruelling trial. I very vividly recall my initial encounter with a black terminal screen, on a Sun Microsystems Unix machine, during my first C programming lab. Panic washed over me as I found myself completely clueless about navigating this challenge. For the first 30 minutes, I remained immobilized and it was only after summoning the courage to approach one of the teaching assistants and confessing my utter inexperience with the computers that I got myself started. This was just the beginning of a huge challenge lied ahead. As the clock ticked, I mustered the determination to engage with the terminal, but the initial hours only yielded a mere 2-3 lines of code. Some of my classmates, in stark contrast, efficiently accomplished the task within half an hour. Attending lectures with unwavering attention became my mantra, though comprehending the intricate subject posed a trial in itself. Even trying to  read books like "The C Programming Language," authored by one of the language's creators, failed to yield substantial success. 

It was, undoubtedly, a humbling experience to transition from being one of the top performers to grappling with a newfound identity as one of the class's less accomplished individuals—especially amidst peers who had participated in international programming olympiads.

What accompanied these challenges were not merely technical, but a roller-coaster of emotions. Frustration set in, self-doubt crept in as I questioned my capability to bridge the gap between my knowledge and the complex world of programming. 

## The Journey

This journey instilled humility in me. Over time, my determination to grasp the unfamiliar and uncover the secrets of programming only grew stronger. I began with a book that my professors discouraged but I could understand it on my own - "Let Us C" by Yashwant Kanetkar. My evenings were dedicated to the library, reading a page or two and writing down notes. Every week, I spent all my allotted lab time attempting assignments, often ending in failure. 

It was during these moments that I found invaluable friends and mentors who recognized my need for help. My wingmates, [Anshit Mandloi]() and [Naman Mitruka](), were instrumental in my journey. They patiently listened, clarified my doubts, and even guided me through basic programming exercises. Their support transformed them from just wingmates into mentors on this challenging path. 

In my second year the university, I met [Harsh Gupta](), who was my batchmate, and he played a pivotal role in my growth as a programmer. His willingness to lend a helping hand on numerous occasions marked a turning point in my journey. He generously shared his knowledge, ensuring I grasped complex concepts and tackled intricate problems with confidence.

After three years of taking various courses, participating in hackathons (with mostly failures), my confidence as a programmer began to bloom. It was finally time to put my skills to the test in the real world.

## MIT

I wanted to be part of the prestigious [Google Summer of Code program](), I first tried to get into the program at the end of my third year at the university but guess what I did not get selected. Instead of getting disappointed, I decided to try again the next year and this time I succeeded and I spent my summer contributing the Julia Programming Language adding support for optimization with complex numbers in their Covex.jl library. And it was during the summer I was invited to speak about my work at Julialang Conference'16 held at MIT, Boston. I always wanted to visit to MIT, MIT was a dream but I had never even in my wildest dreams that I would be invited to speak at a conference there. It just felt like all my struggles and hardwork was meant to lead me to MIT without me even realizing it. It is so far one of the proudest moments of my life. and it led me to believe that no matter how late you start in your life you, you can still end up doing things that you never even dreamt of. I would end the blogpost with the link to the talk I presented.
