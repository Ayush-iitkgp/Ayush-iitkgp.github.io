**The Camino de Santiago is not just a walk; it is a journey of the soul, where every step carries the weight of countless stories and the promise of personal transformation**. 

That is how I would describe my experience of walking the Camino.

It was during a call with a very close friend of mine in the midst of long and very hard Berlin winter that I decided to hike the Camino De Santiago. People have different motivations for the walk, mine was to establish a deeper connection with myself and push myself physically to try to achieve long distance walking of around 130 km in 5 days that I had never ever conceived in my wildest imaginations.

In this blogpost, I would share the learnings and realizations from the experience I had :)

### **Preparation is the key**

Since, I had never imagined walking 130 km, taking on this challenge meant I had to prepare myself physically and mentally.

I picked up a new sports hobby high intensity indoor cycling (spinning) and regularly attended HIIT classes. I also went hiking for atleast 10 km on the outskirts of Berlin almost every weekend leading upto the Camino.

Last but not the least, taking care of the logistical planning immensely made the experience more pleasureful.

### **During challenging moments, take one step at a time**

There were often the very difficult and demanding moments, when I felt like giving up and it is in these moments that embracing a steadfast approach of reminding myself to take each step of the journey one at a time helped me push forward and not give up. 

Take "_one step at a time_" sound so simple that I often never paid attention to it but it was during this walk I finally experienced how powerful of a statement it is. 

### **Remember to surrender and let go**

I had different set of expectations from the hike. But a lot of things did not go as planned. One the first day of the hike we had to walk 30 KM without getting a proper meal, on the fourth day we walked 5 KM more than we had planned, my body would experience pain in different parts every other hour.

It is in these moments surrendering myself to the journey and letting go of the fear of the outcome allowed me to approach the hike in a more relaxed and peaceful manner and gave me the mental space to enjoy the journey even in the face of the hardships.

### **Human mind and spirit is  unconquerable**

My friends and me started to get foot blisters starting from the day 1 of the hike, I met countless people having difficulties even taking a single step, I developed fever on the day 3 of the hike, one of the friend's knee problems re-appeared omn the day 2 of the hike, we met people as old as 70 years who have been walking for few hundred KMs but despite all these difficulties we all had one firm goal "Santiago" that no one was willing to compromise on.

The journey made me experience closely the power of human mind and spirit that despite countless issues all of us wanted to reach Santiago at all cost and all of us finally did!

### **Conclusion**

I hope I was able to inspire some of you with my experience. I fell in so much love with the experience that I am already planning another Camino De Santiago next spring for approximately 200 KMs. I would conclude the blogpost with a picture of one of the prized possessions from the trip.
