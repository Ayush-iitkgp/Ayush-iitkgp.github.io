Today is exactly a month since I was given a responsibility of co-leading a small team of software developers at [Adacta Fintech](https://www.adacta-fintech.com/) to develop insurance solutions for our clients. It was intimidating at the beginning not becuase I was taking this responsibility for the first time but also, it came at a time when Tech Lead and the Product Manager were on vacations simultaneously and the senior developers in the team were moving to other opportunities in their careers.



See you next time till then keep laughing, spreading happiness and the most importantly living this journey called life!!!!
