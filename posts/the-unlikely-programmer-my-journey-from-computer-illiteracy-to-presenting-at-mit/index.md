## Introduction

Only a select few of my closest friends are aware of my journey from computer illiteracy to becoming a computer scientist. Recently, my very dear friend and my first mentor, [Anshit Mandloi](), encouraged me to pen down a blog post about my progression—how I managed to transcend my lack of knowledge in computers and present my work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) within four years. 

The purpose of sharing this deeply personal account is to provide inspiration to individuals who, like me, hail from similar backgrounds and may be grappling with doubts about their potential to navigate the vast landscape of technology. Through this blogpost, my hope is to kindle the spark of possibility that with unwavering determination, the most remarkable transformations can be well within our reach.

## The Beginnings

I come from small town situated in one of the less developed regions of North India. Hailing from a family of eight, my father shouldered the role of the sole provider. In such circumstances, pursuing quality education proved to be an uphill battle, rendering the idea of having a computer at home an unattainable dream. Hence, my exposure to computers was limited to the few sessions we had during our high school curriculum. 

Destiny, however, had its designs, I managed to emerge successful in the IIT-JEE exam (an exam with an acceptance rate of a 1 in 500). This paved the way for my academic journey, leading me to opt for the study of Mathematics and Computer Science at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur.

## The Challenges

IIT Kharagpur marked the beginning of a genuine trial. I vividly recall my initial encounter with a completely black terminal, on a Sun Microsystems Unix machine, during my inaugural C programming lab. Panic washed over me as I found myself completely clueless about navigating this challenge. For the first 30 minutes, I remained immobilized, grappling with the overwhelming feeling of terminal paralysis. It was only after summoning the courage to approach one of the teaching assistants and confessing my utter inexperience with terminal-based machine that I could get myself started. This incident served as a glaring realization that a huge challenge lay ahead, an endeavor of Herculean proportions. As the clock ticked, I mustered the determination to engage with the terminal, but the initial hours only yielded a mere 2-3 lines of code. Some of my classmates, in stark contrast, efficiently accomplished the task within half an hour. Attending lectures with unwavering attention became my mantra, though comprehending the intricate subject posed a trial in itself. Even trying to  read books like "The C Programming Language," authored by one of the language's creators, failed to yield substantial success. 

It was, undoubtedly, a humbling experience to transition from being one of the top performers to grappling with a newfound identity as one of the class's less accomplished individuals—especially amidst peers who had participated in international programming olympiads.

What accompanied these challenges were not merely technical, but a rollercoaster of emotions. Frustration set in, self-doubt crept in as I questioned my capability to bridge the gap between my knowledge and the complex world of programming.
