**The Camino de Santiago is not just a walk; it is a journey of the soul, where every step carries the weight of countless stories and the promise of personal transformation**. 

That is how I would describe my experience of walking the Camino.

It was during a call with a very close friend of mine in the midst of long and very hard Berlin winter that I decided to hike the Camino De Santiago. People have different motivations for the walk, mine was to establish a deeper connection with myself and push myself physically to try to achieve long distance walking of around 130 km in 5 days that I had never ever conceived in my wildest imaginations.

In this blogpost, I would share the learnings and realizations from the experience I had :)

**Preparation is the key**
Since, I had never imagined walking 130 km, taking on this challenge meant I had to prepare myself physically and mentally. I picked up new a new sports hobby high intensity indoor cycling (spinning) and regularly attended HIIT classes. I also went hiking for 20 km or more on the outskirts of Berlin almost every weekend leading upto the Camino.


See you next time till then keep laughing, spreading happiness and the most importantly living this journey called life!!!!
